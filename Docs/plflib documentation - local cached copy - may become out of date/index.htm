<h1>PLF C++ Library</h1>

<p>PLF is a collection of library modules for C++. At this stage I am only releasing plf::colony and plf::stack, container class templates similar in usage to STL's std::vector and std::stack template but with better performance and without pointer/iterator invalidation. Please click on the links below to learn more about them and download. More library modules may come in time. All modules are under a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib_License">Zlib permissive license</a> and support both C++11 and C++0x. Tested compilers include Clang 3.61, GCC 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 (both 32-bit and 64-bit), MS Visual C++ 2010, 2013 and 2015.</p>
